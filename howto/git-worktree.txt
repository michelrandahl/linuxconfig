# Note that windows/dotnet doesn't seem to like very long paths so we might want to move the worktrees directory further up

# to list branches, `cd` into one of the branch directories
git worktree list

# to checkout existing remote branch (note: might need to perform a git fetch first)
git worktree add ../some-existing-branch some-existing-branch
# (NOTE: you can also checkout an old commit, just replace `some-existing-branch` with the commit-sha)

# to create and add a new branch
git worktree add -b new-branch ../new-branch

# to remove a branch (note: there should be no trailing '/')
git worktree remove ../new-branch
# as opposed to just `rm -rf` this will also remove the branch from local repository
