# Note that windows/dotnet doesn't seem to like very long paths
# so when on windows/wsl we might want to move the worktrees directory further up

# to list branches, `cd` into one of the branch directories
`git worktree list`

# to checkout existing remote branch (note: might need to perform a git fetch first)
`git worktree add ../some-existing-branch some-existing-branch`
# (NOTE: you can also checkout an old commit, just replace `some-existing-branch` with the commit-sha)

# to create and add a new branch
`git worktree add -b new-branch ../new-branch`

# to remove a branch (note: there should be no trailing '/')
`git worktree remove ../new-branch`
# as opposed to just `rm -rf` this will also remove the branch from local repository

# move all untracked and uncommitted changes to a new branch
# (say for example if you have been working on main with some experiment that you now want to create a branch with)
`git stash push --include-untracked`
# then create a new branch as normally with git worktree and in the new branch dir:
`git stash pop`
