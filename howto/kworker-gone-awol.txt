On a MacBook with linux installed, I have often experienced a cpu core constantly going full throttle for semingly no reason and the system behaving weird.
It has something to do with a 'kworker' that is going crazy... Following procedure will take care of it...


# Identify the sucker with
`$ grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/`
# This will yield a list of interupts... the ones with high numbers are probably the AWOL ones... lets kill them!
`$ echo disable > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe16`
# where gpe1B is the offender
